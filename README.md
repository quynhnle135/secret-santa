# Secret Santa Matcher
The Secret Santa Matcher is a simple, interactive program designed to randomly assign participants in a Secret Santa exchange. It offers three methods for generating pairings: using fake names for demonstration, a binary search method, and a circular assignment method for real participants:
- **Faker:** Generates fake names to demonstrate how the program works.
- **Binary Search:** Allows the input of real participants' names and applies a binary search method to match pairings.
- **Circular Assignment:** Accepts real participants' names and uses a circular assignment method to ensure everyone is matched without duplicates.
